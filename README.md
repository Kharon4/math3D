# math3D

### math3D is a simple cpp lib for 3d math calculations, using vector algebra.

### It implements :
- [x] vec3 for different cpp data types
- [x] Basic 3d math with lines (rays) , planes and points
- [x] vector manipulation:
	- [x] translation
	- [x] scaling
	- [x] rotation
- [x] CUDA supported vec3
- [x] CUDA supported linear math

### Future plans :
- [ ] support for Matrix based transformations
